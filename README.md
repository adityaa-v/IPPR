The purpose of the second assignment was the "Project Implementation" section. 
In this section, we tried to implement the different Classifiers and Evaluate these through coding. 
The code was written in Matlab and the dataset video was uploaded into the code.
The code was evaluated through "Motion-Based Multiple Object Tracking" using the "Human 3" dataset extracted online. 
Then another dataset was extracted from online to evaluate the "CamShift" classifier. The "CamShift" code helped to detect the face of the person in the video. 
Once the coding was implemented, Matlab was able to load the classifiers successfully, thus ensuring that the Tracking of people is successfully studied. 

For the project, the roles of each individual in the group were distributed evenly. 

The coding sectionn in Matlab was CONTRIBUTED equally amongst all the members. All other sections were distributed. The roles of each person is descibed below.
